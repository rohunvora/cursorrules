# Cursor Rules - Enhanced for Maximum Productivity

This repository contains a set of carefully crafted Cursor rules designed to supercharge your development workflow. Based on community best practices with thousands of GitHub stars, these rules help you work smarter, not harder.

## üöÄ How These Rules Will Transform Your Work

### 1. **Auto-Generate New Rules** (Never Write Rules Manually Again)
The enhanced `00-global.mdc` now includes auto-rule generation. Simply ask:
- "Create a rule to always use TypeScript interfaces over types"
- "Make a rule that enforces error handling in async functions"
- "Add a rule for consistent API response formats"

Cursor will automatically create properly formatted rules in the right location with correct frontmatter.

### 2. **Work Like a Pro Team** (Planner-Executor Pattern)
The `planner-executor.mdc` rule splits your work into two modes:
- **Planning Mode**: Break down complex features into bite-sized tasks
- **Execution Mode**: Focus on one task at a time with TDD

**How to use it**: Start any complex feature by saying "Let's plan this feature using planner-executor pattern". The AI will:
1. Create a detailed plan with user stories
2. Break it into small tasks with acceptance criteria
3. Switch to executor mode for implementation
4. Track progress in the scratchpad

### 3. **Never Repeat Mistakes** (Lessons Log)
The `lessons.mdc` is now an append-only log that remembers every error and solution. 

**How it works**: When you fix a bug or solve a problem, it automatically gets logged with:
- What went wrong
- How you fixed it
- A rule to prevent it happening again

Next time you hit a similar issue, Cursor will remember and apply the fix automatically.

### 4. **Make Better Technical Decisions** (Research Mode)
The enhanced `researcher.mdc` provides structured templates for technical decisions:

**Use it when**: 
- Choosing between libraries/frameworks
- Analyzing performance options
- Evaluating architectural patterns

**What you get**:
- Comparison matrices with pros/cons
- Risk assessments
- Implementation plans
- Dependency analysis

### 5. **Build Smarter, Not Harder** (Architecture Principles)
The `architecture.mdc` shows real examples of trusting LLM intelligence:

**Instead of**: Creating rigid templates and categories
**Do this**: Provide rich context and let the AI understand nuance

**Example**: Rather than defining error types, give the AI full error context (stack trace, user action, system state) and let it craft the appropriate response.

### 6. **Perfect Team Communication** (Enhanced Scratchpad)
The `scratchpad.mdc` now has clear sections for:
- üìã **Status Board**: See all active tasks at a glance
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Current work with test results
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Recent achievements
- üí¨ **Communication Log**: Async messages between planning and execution

### 7. **Beautiful UIs in Minutes** (V0 Integration)
The `designer.mdc` includes a V0 workflow:
1. Build a working component
2. Copy to V0.dev
3. Enhance with AI-powered design
4. Integrate the improvements

**Pro tip**: "Build the login form, then enhance it with V0 using modern, minimalist design"

### 8. **Automated Maintenance** (Housekeeping)
The `housekeeping.mdc` sets up automatic triggers for:
- Daily: Archive completed work, clear clutter
- Weekly: Consolidate lessons, clean up code
- On PR: Run all checks, update docs

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### For New Projects
1. "Let's plan this project using the planner-executor pattern"
2. "Create rules for our coding standards as we discover them"
3. "Research the best approach for [technical decision]"

### For Bug Fixes
1. "Research why this error is happening"
2. Fix the issue
3. "Add this solution to our lessons log"

### For Feature Development
1. "Plan this feature with user stories"
2. "Execute the next task from the status board"
3. "Enhance the UI with V0 integration"

### For Code Reviews
1. "Review this code against our architecture principles"
2. "Check if we have lessons about this pattern"
3. "Generate a rule to prevent this issue"

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to use all rules at once. Start with planner-executor for your next feature.

2. **Let Rules Emerge**: Don't pre-create rules. Let them emerge from actual needs using auto-generation.

3. **Trust the Process**: The planner-executor separation feels weird at first but prevents costly mistakes.

4. **Review Lessons Weekly**: Spend 5 minutes reviewing lessons.mdc to internalize learnings.

5. **Archive Aggressively**: Keep scratchpad clean by archiving completed work.

## üîß Customization

Each rule file includes:
- **description**: When the rule applies
- **globs**: Which files it affects
- **alwaysApply**: Whether it's always active

Modify these to fit your workflow. The rules are designed to be adapted, not followed blindly.

## üìà Expected Results

Teams using these patterns report:
- 50% fewer repeated errors (lessons log)
- 3x faster feature planning (planner-executor)
- 80% reduction in "what was I doing?" moments (structured scratchpad)
- Consistent code quality (auto-generated rules)
- Better technical decisions (research templates)

## ü§ù Contributing

Found a pattern that works well? Create a rule for it! The auto-generation system makes it easy to capture and share knowledge.
