# Cursor Rules Overview

This document provides a quick reference to all modular rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## How Rules Work

### Always Applied Rules
Files marked with `alwaysApply: true` in their frontmatter are automatically loaded in every Cursor session. These include:
- Core guardrails and constraints
- The Planner/Executor workflow system
- Documentation standards
- Repository hygiene practices
- Accumulated lessons

### Manual Rules
Files marked with `manual: true` must be explicitly loaded when needed:
- Use `researcher.mdc` for deep technical investigations
- Use `designer.mdc` for UI/UX decisions
- Use `architecture.mdc` for system design discussions

## Quick Reference

### To load a manual rule:
Ask Cursor to "load the researcher rule" or "apply designer guidelines"

### To add a new rule:
1. Create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `description` and either `alwaysApply: true` or `manual: true`
3. Update this overview document

### To archive old content:
Follow the archival rules in `scratchpad.mdc` - move to `.cursor/archive/` when content becomes irrelevant due to pivots or changes in direction.
