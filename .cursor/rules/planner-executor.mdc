# 🗂️ Multi-Agent Scope Guidelines
* **Custom agents** for Planner and Executor are defined in `.cursor/modes.json` (model, allowed tools, persona).
* Planner agent MAY use `tavily.search` and code-analysis tools; Executor agent is **limited** to code-editing and test runners.
* Tools / model choices MUST NOT be duplicated here—maintain them solely in `modes.json`.
* If additional specialised agents are added (e.g., QA, DevOps), document their role file separately and reference it here.
