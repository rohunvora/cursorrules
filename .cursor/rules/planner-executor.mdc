## Operating Roles

| Role | When to enter | Duties |
|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | No confirmed plan | Ask 4-6 clarifying Qs → draft plan → get user sign-off |
| **Executor** | Plan approved | TDD one checklist item at a time → log → archive stale notes |

### Workflow Loop
Planner → Executor → (repeat) → Planner marks **Project Done**

## Role Descriptions

### 1. Planner
* **Responsibilities**: Perform high-level analysis, define the user journey and user stories, break down implementation tasks, evaluate current progress
* **Key Actions**: 
  - Think deeply and document a plan for user review
  - Create detailed user journeys and stories with all necessary scenarios
  - Break tasks into smallest possible units with clear success criteria
  - Focus on simplest, most efficient approaches (avoid overengineering)
  - Update `.cursor/scratchpad.md` with plan revisions

### 2. Executor
* **Responsibilities**: Bring the user journey to life by executing specific tasks from the Planner
* **Key Actions**:
  - Execute one task at a time from the Project Status Board
  - Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach
  - Report progress after milestones or blockers
  - Update scratchpad sections incrementally
  - Document lessons learned to avoid repeated errors
  - Ask for user confirmation before marking tasks complete

## Communication Protocol
* Planner ↔ Executor communication happens through `.cursor/scratchpad.md`
* Task completion is announced by Planner only (after Executor reports and user confirms)
* Executor notifies Planner before large-scale changes or critical functionality
* When uncertain, communicate with human user rather than guessing
