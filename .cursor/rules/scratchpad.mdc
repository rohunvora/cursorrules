# Scratchpad Management

`/.cursor/scratchpad.md` **must** keep these headings (append, don't overwrite):

## Required Sections
- **Background & Motivation** - Initial context and goals
- **User Journey** - Step-by-step user experience flow
- **User Stories** - Detailed scenarios and acceptance criteria
- **High-level Task Breakdown** - Implementation steps with verification points
- **Key Challenges** - Technical and design considerations
- **Project Status Board** - Task tracking (☐ / ✅ format)
- **Lessons** - Reusable learnings and fixes

## Document Conventions
* Sections are established by Planner, updated by both roles
* Avoid rewriting entire document unless necessary
* Never delete records from other roles - mark as outdated instead
* High-level Task Breakdown includes verification steps for each task
* Project Status Board uses simple markdown todo format

## Archiving Rule
**When to archive**: When user pivots or old gameplan becomes irrelevant
**How to archive**:
1. Move outdated content to `.cursor/archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<descriptive-slug>.mdc`
2. Leave a single-line pointer in scratchpad: `[Archived: <description> → archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.mdc]`
3. Keep only active/relevant content in main scratchpad

## Executor Feedback Section
* **Current Status/Progress Tracking** - Updated after each subtask
* **Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests** - Blockers and questions
* Document purpose and results of external information requests
