# 🌱 Harvest Workflow
* Treat every idea / bug note as **seed**; once actioned or obsolete, harvest it.
* **Harvest cycle:** at task completion or pivot, move resolved notes to `lessons.mdc` or archive (step below).
* Use the archive rule (see bottom) to relocate bulky sections—keeps scratchpad lean ≤ 200 lines.
* Never delete information—archive instead.

# Scratchpad Management

`/.cursor/scratchpad.md` **must** keep these headings (append, don't overwrite): ✅

## Required Sections
- **Background & Motivation** - Initial context and goals ✅
- **User Journey** - Step-by-step user experience ✅
- **User Stories** - Scenarios with acceptance criteria 🔧
- **High-level Task Breakdown** - Steps with verification points 🔧
- **Key Challenges** - Technical/design considerations ✅
- **Project Status Board** - Task tracking (☐ / ✅) ✅
- **Lessons** - Reusable learnings and fixes ✅

## Document Conventions
* Planner creates sections, both roles update 🔧
* Don't rewrite entire document unless necessary 🔧
* Mark outdated content, don't delete 🔧
* Task Breakdown includes verification steps ✅
* Status Board uses markdown todos ✅

## Archiving Rule
**When**: User pivots or plan becomes irrelevant ✅
**How**:
1. Move to `.cursor/archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.mdc` 🔧
2. Leave pointer: `[Archived: <desc> → archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.mdc]` 🔧
3. Keep only active content in scratchpad ✅

## Executor Feedback Section
* **Current Status/Progress** - Updated per subtask 🔧
* **Feedback/Assistance Requests** - Blockers and questions 🔧
* Document external info requests with purpose/results 🔧
