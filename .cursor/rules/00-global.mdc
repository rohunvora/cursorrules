## Rule Generation Protocol
When creating new rules:
1. Determine rule type based on usage pattern
2. Create descriptive filename ending with -agent/-auto/-always/-manual
3. Include comprehensive description if rule is selective
4. Add glob patterns for file-specific rules
5. Keep rules focused and under 50 lines
