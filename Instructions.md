# Instructions - Migrated to Modular Rules

The instruction system has been migrated to a modular rule architecture.

**All rules are now located in: `.cursor/rules/`**

See `.cursor/rules-overview.md` for a complete guide to the new system.

## Quick Start
- Core rules (global guardrails, Planner/Executor workflow, etc.) are automatically loaded
- Specialized rules (researcher, designer, architecture) can be loaded on demand
- The system maintains the same Planner â†” Executor workflow with enhanced modularity
